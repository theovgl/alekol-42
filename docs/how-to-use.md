# How do I use the Alekol bot?

The bot is straightforward : it adds a role when you come at school, and removes it when you leave.

You can interact with it using a bunch of commands.

### `/auth`

This command is used to authenticate yourself with the bot. You will be able to either register or unregister.

> If you call this command in private messages, you will be able to unregister from all the guilds you are in.

### `/ping`

Pong.

### `/role`

This command allows you to change the handled role (the role being added or removed by the bot).

> It is reserved for admins or users with the Manage server permission.
> The role needs to exist, and both the user and the bots must have rights over it (otherwise it won't even appear in the list).

### `/spy login`

This command returns the location of the user with the matching login.

> You need to be registered to the bot in at least one server or in private messages.
