## Register to the bot

In order to get tracked by the bot and use some command, you need to register to the bot.

The `/auth` command allows you to do that, and later, to unregister.

## Set the handled role

The *handled role* is the role that will be given to your server's members when they log at school.

You can set it using the `/role` command.
